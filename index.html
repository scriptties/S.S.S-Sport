<p style="color:white;"><br><br> #1 do not cross the edge lines or you'll be considered out of the game. <br>
#2 there is only a single runner on each team, he has to dodge the opposing team which is trying to stop him from getting a goal ( each team goes to the side of the runner that isn't on there team ) aswell as 2 defenders.

<p style="color:white;">#3 the defenders have a range around them ( the radius size is decided at the start of the match )<br> you can't touch the range, and if you go inside you can't leave,<br> the only way to get a goal would be to make the defender stand near it so its within the range.</p>
